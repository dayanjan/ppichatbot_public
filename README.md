## Abstract
Patients with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) often take proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to aid nutrient absorption or treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but long-term use may lead to adverse effects which can be concerning in this vulnerable patient population. Barriers to successful deprescribing of PPIs in pwCF may include healthcare professional (HCP) time and knowledge around deprescribing, as well as patient access to the healthcare team if new symptoms or questions arise. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in the deprescribing communication process can enhance patient access to accurate and useful information that can support the deprescribing process, while also decreasing HCP workload. The purpose of our pilot study is to examine the creation and integration of an AI deprescribing information tool, utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 Large Language Model, aimed at assessing its suitability for patient education.  We make the tool available to the greater community to test and assess its utility and limits of accuracy. This report details the development of the tool.

## Technological Specification
The application is primarily in the form of a highly specific system message that instructs and OpenAI GPT model. The application can be tested by using the provided Python script that utilizes Python Streamlit. You will require an openAI API Key for this. The streamlit application can be deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, Google Cloud Run or any other compatible hosting platform
